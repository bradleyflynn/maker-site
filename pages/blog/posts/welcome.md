**DDPSC Pi Pals 2015**     

In 2014, DDPSC received a grant from the Raspberry Pi Education fund to engage local educators in incorporating open-source hardware, such as Raspberry Pis, into their curriculums. We have expertise in plant science, computer science, and in using open-source hardware in our research, but want to determine the best ways to help educators to incorporate open-source hardware into their classrooms. If you are interested in getting more information on this program please remember to fill out a survey and identify yourself as a local educator.

**The DDPSC Maker Group**

The Maker Group at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center is a forum for all members of the Center to explore constructing low-cost hardware and software engineering tools. The Group focuses on supporting projects that will directly benefit a wide range of research at the Center but also encourages fun home projects. By promoting custom engineering projects at the Center, the Maker Group serves as a significant source of cross discipline training to the postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, technicians and staff.
