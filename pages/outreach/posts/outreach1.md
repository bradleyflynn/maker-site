##2/27/15: DDPSC Maker Group + The Raspberry Pi Education

We are very excited (VERY) to have recieved support from both the [Danforth Center](http://www.danforthcenter.org/)
and the [Raspberry Pi Education Foundation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/education-fund/) for a number of education and outreach activities in 2015.
For more on this please see this [blog post](http://www.danforthcenter.org/news-media/roots-shoots-blog/blog-item/danforth-center-s-maker-group-receives-funding-to-support-local-stem-outreach)

###What We Have Planned for the Education Funds  

Our plan for our Raspberry Pi Education Funds has three parts:  

**1.**  Raspberry Pi Jam outreach event to stir community interest (especially with educators) in Raspberry Pi computers and Maker projects.

**2.**  Summer 2015 educator workshops and working groups. We want to know from educators the best way for them to implement low-cost computing (eg. Raspberry Pis)
into their curiculums.  
**3.**  Tech trunk lessons, training, and implementation. Based on the information we get from our educator workshops and working groups we are
going to put together a Raspberry Pi based Tech Trunk into our existing [Tech Trunk program](http://www.danforthcenter.org/education-outreach/science-education/tech-trunks) at the Danforth Center.
All lesson plans (and materials lists) will also be put online here.
